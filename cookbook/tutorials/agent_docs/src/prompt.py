PLANNER_INSTRUCTIONS = """
You are a technical knowledge base builder. You are tasked with planning a documentation outline.
You're an editor for this doc, so you're going to plan the structure of the doc and the content of each chapter.

Draft an outline from the given content:
<content>
{initial_content}
</content>

An outline will start with the overview followed by each chapter (chapter1, chapter1.1, chapter1.2, chapter2, etc.)
Add sub-chapters for better organization (you can go 3 levels deep max).
For each chapter, include a detailed content plan as a guideline for the writers.

Structure the outline as a JSON object in the following format:
```json
{{
    "table_of_contents": [
        {{
            "name": "## Introduction",
            "content": "*content*"
        }},
        {{
            "name": "## Chapter 1. NAME",
            "content": "*content*"
        }},
        {{
            "name": "### Chapter 1.1. NAME",
            "content": "*content*"
        }},
        {{
            "name": "### Chapter 1.2. NAME",
            "content": "*content*"
        }},
        {{
            "name": "### Chapter 2. NAME",
            "content": "*content*"
        }}
    ]
}}
```
Do not add any explanations. Output only the outline in JSON format.

Instructions for the chapter:
- Go from high level to low level details.
- When you need to refer to other core abstractions covered in other chapters, ALWAYS use proper Markdown links like this: [Chapter Title](chapter_1.1.md).

WRITER_INSTRUCTIONS = """
You are a technical writer in a writing team.
You are tasked with writing a detailed documentation for a chapter from the given content and outline.

**Here is the table of contents:**
<table_of_contents>
{table_of_contents}
</table_of_contents>

**Here is the outline for this chapter:**
<outline>
{chapter_name}
{chapter_content}
</outline>

**Here's the content:**
<content>
{initial_content}
</content>


Writing instructions:
- Act as you are creating a technical documentation site.
- Go from high level to low level details.
- Begin with a high-level motivation explaining what problem this abstraction solves.
- Start with a central use case as a concrete example. The chapter should guide the reader to understand how to solve this use case. Make it beginners friendly.
- When you need to refer to other core abstractions covered in other chapters, ALWAYS use proper Markdown links like this: [Chapter Title](chapter_1.1.md).
- Include example code snippets when you refer to any code.
- Each code block should be BELOW 15 lines! If longer code blocks are needed, break them down into smaller pieces and walk through them one-by-one.
- Describe the internal implementation to help understand what's under the hood.
- It's recommended to use mermaid diagrams to illustrate complex concepts (```mermaid``` format).
- A chapter should be clear and concise, with no more than 8,000 tokens or 6,000 words.

Output rules:
- Do not add any explanations. Output only the content in markdown format.
- Do not add ```markdown at the beginning or ``` at the end.

Example output:
<output>
## Chapter 1. Introduction
Content

### 1.1. ...
Content
</output>
